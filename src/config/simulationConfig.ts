 * M4 household-demand, participation and welfare-signal controls (REQ-CONFIG-007).
 *
 * The field list is the M4 subset of section 33 "Configuration surface" of
 * `06 - Handoff/06 — POPULATION_DEMOGRAPHY_CLANS_CONTRACTS.md`, spelled as the
 * sections that state each control spell it. Section 8 of Handoff/03 is the
 * baseline-value owner, as `HANDOFF-REPAIR-005`/`-010` establish for every other
 * block — but it states its population baseline in a different vocabulary
 * (`consumptionBudgetShare*`, `precautionaryCashFloorMonths`,
 * `needSubstitutionElasticity`, `healthEmaAlpha`), so sixteen of the twenty
 * controls below have no reachable value and are declared undefaulted rather than
 * guessed. See `docs/spec/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, Q-002.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, because another owner already holds the value:
 *
 * - `workerEpsilon` (section 9). Workers are measured in worker-equivalents, a
 *   quantity, and `NumericConfig.quantityEpsilon` owns that tolerance —
 *   `HANDOFF-REPAIR-010` states the precedent and #528 applied it to `laborEpsilon`.
 * - The `P_raw` prosperity weights (section 10). Section 33 enumerates what
 *   `PopulationConfig` must centralize and prosperity weights are not in it; they
 *   are stated inline as coefficients summing to 1.0, and section 33's "Scenario
 *   files may override values but may not introduce new bespoke formulas without
 *   schema version change" is exactly what a scenario-tunable weight vector would
 *   defeat. They belong to the requirement that owns the welfare formula.
 * - `NeedCategoryDefinition` instances. Handoff/03 section 8: "Need quantities,
 *   nutrition/health contribution, spoilage and substitute groups belong to
 *   GoodDefinition/NeedDefinition, not global config." The shape lives with the
 *   other per-definition registries in `./definitionPack.ts`.
 *
 * Demography, migration, mobility and every `ClanConfig` control are deferred by
 * this requirement's own statement and are absent; `EXECUTION_ORDER.md` puts them
 * in M6 and M8.
