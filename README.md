# TradeCraftSimulation

A deterministic economic simulation that models price formation, trade, and settlement in an
interconnected local-market system. The **canonical implementation is TypeScript** and the engine
is browser-capable today; the full Worker-backed interactive observatory around that same engine is
scheduled for M11. The current [GitHub Pages](https://drevendev.github.io/trade_simulation/)
deployment leads with the consolidated M3 LocalMarket experience — price and traded-quantity trends,
a selected-tick market balance and settlement split, and headline metrics — and keeps the earlier
M0–M2 milestone previews and the legacy run viewer behind a collapsed history disclosure. All of it
is static, one-way milestone output, not the canonical engine executing in the browser.

## Current state

**Milestone 1 & 2:** Complete. Canonical TypeScript implementation provides:
- Deterministic world genesis with configured regions, currencies, clans and production units
- Sixteen-phase tick orchestrator with stable execution order
- Stock reconciliation across all economic categories (money, goods, population, capital, resources)
- Normalized accounting spine: typed MONEY and GOOD signed deltas plus PHYSICAL_LOSS attribution,
  reconciled at phase and tick boundaries

**Milestone 3:** Complete, and released as `v0.3.0` once every one of its ledger rows carried the
merge commit that landed it. Local markets and transaction settlement. Per-requirement evidence
lives in the [implementation ledger](docs/spec/implementation_status.csv); see
[Known scope boundaries](#known-scope-boundaries) for what that ledger currently records. Local
market implementation adds:
- Ephemeral MarketIntent contracts and the budget commitments that back them
- Log-space price formation using supply/demand expectations, bounded per tick by
  `maxAbsoluteLogPriceMovePerTick`
- Deterministic proportional local clearing with stable allocation
- Atomic market settlement with tax-aware money and goods transfers
- Canonical M3 local-market telemetry for diagnostics (shortage/surplus rates, cleared/traded quantities, collection efficiency)

**Interactive viewer:** [Open the M3 LocalMarket Pages experience](https://drevendev.github.io/trade_simulation/) — price and traded-quantity trends, the selected-tick market balance and settlement split, and headline metrics from the deterministic golden run, with the M0–M2 previews and the legacy run viewer under the history disclosure.

## Understanding M3 local markets

New to the simulation? Start here:

- **[How the Local Market Works](docs/reference/local-market-guide.md)** — Price formation, supply/demand, shortage/surplus signals, and why deterministic ordering matters.
- **[What Happens When a Trade Settles](docs/reference/market-settlement-and-taxes.md)** — Money and goods flow, buyer-gross vs. seller-net prices, consumption tax collection, and accounting reconciliation.

## Building and testing

The current codebase is **TypeScript + Node.js + Vitest** for the canonical simulation engine.

```bash
# Verify everything builds and tests pass
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

### Legacy reference oracle

The original **C# / .NET 9** implementation in `TradeCraftSimulation/` is retained as a stable
reference oracle for baseline behavior, not as the active development target. It remains
functional and tested, but canonical feature development occurs in TypeScript.

To build and test the legacy code:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

## Project structure

- `src/` — Canonical TypeScript simulation engine
  - `config/` — Configuration layers and validation
  - `domain/` — Core types, IDs, registries, and numeric contracts
  - `simulation/` — Tick orchestrator, market clearing, settlement, telemetry
  - `diagnostics/` — Milestone preview generation and test utilities

- `TradeCraftSimulation/` — Legacy C# reference implementation (frozen at M0)
- `docs/` — GitHub Pages viewer and milestone preview artifacts
- `docs/spec/` — Implementation specification and handoff documentation

## Implementation evidence

- **Specification registry:** [`docs/spec/mirror/REQUIREMENTS_REGISTRY.csv`](docs/spec/mirror/REQUIREMENTS_REGISTRY.csv)
- **Implementation status:** [`docs/spec/implementation_status.csv`](docs/spec/implementation_status.csv)
- **Specification handoff:** [`docs/spec/mirror/06 - Handoff/`](docs/spec/mirror/) (numbered sections covering scope, schema, config, markets, acceptance, and migration)
- **ADRs:** [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — Architectural decisions (identity, numeric contracts, etc.)

## Invariants and guarantees

The canonical simulation is **deterministic**:
- Same configuration, seed, and tick count produce identical replay hash across runs
- No random-number consumption outside of reproducible seeded calls

**M3 local market settlement** (REQ-MARKET-001..005 and REQ-ACCEPTANCE-004, recorded IMPLEMENTED in
the ledger):
- Atomic transaction settlement with preflight affordability/inventory checks and tax-aware transfers
- Deterministic proportional clearing within a tick/phase
- Phase and tick boundary reconciliation: conserved MONEY and GOOD stock deltas reconcile by asset key within configured tolerance (1e-9 by default)
- Typed ledger entries for transactions, tax transfers, and physical losses with explicit attribution

## Known scope boundaries

[`docs/spec/implementation_status.csv`](docs/spec/implementation_status.csv) is the authoritative
per-requirement implementation record: one evidence row per requirement identifier, written by the
pull request that earns it. [`docs/spec/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`](docs/spec/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
is generated from that file and is presentation only. The summary below follows it.

**Recorded IMPLEMENTED:**
- Core deterministic orchestration and ledger framework
- Configuration, scenario definition, and world genesis
- Local market price formation, clearing, and settlement with tax (REQ-MARKET-001..005,
  REQ-ACCEPTANCE-004)
- M3 representation: the consolidated LocalMarket Pages experience (REQ-VISUALIZATION-006), the
  README and public project text (REQ-VISUALIZATION-007), and the two public explainer articles
  (REQ-VISUALIZATION-008)

**Closed:**
- Milestone 3. A milestone is released only once every one of its ledger rows reads IMPLEMENTED
  *and* carries the merge commit that landed it, and `release-tag.yml` makes that judgement
  mechanically from the ledger rather than by hand. All nine M3 rows now meet it, and the tagger
  cut `v0.3.0 — M3` on that evidence.

**Not implemented yet (later milestones M4–M8):**
- Production, labor allocation, household consumption and population cohorts in a one-region closed economy (M4)
- Inter-regional transport, trade logistics and FX (M5)
- Fiscal policy, governance, clans and debt (M6)
- Monetary policy and currency dynamics (M7)
- Demography, migration and expansion (M8)

**Out of scope (core v1 hard exclusions):**
- Housing, property, speculative finance, or individuals as modeled entities
- Warfare or explicit political dynamics
