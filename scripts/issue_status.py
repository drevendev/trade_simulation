"""The status axis of an Issue is a true answer, and the forge keeps it one.

A `status:*` label answers one question - what state is this Issue in - and it is worth
something only while the answer is true. Two rules keep it true, and until now both were
left to whoever touched the Issue last:

* **A closed Issue carries no `status:*` label** (#121). `cleanup_closed_issues.py` has
  said so since #130, and no workflow ever ran it: 88 closed Issues still carried a
  status label when #770 was filed, #765 among them with `status:in-progress`.
* **An open Issue carries at most one: the one applied last** (#214). The AUTHOR runbook
  tells its role to replace the old label rather than add one beside it, and a model with
  no memory does not always do it. #160 sat in `status:ready` and `status:in-progress`
  for fifteen hours; #200 did the same ten minutes after `rework_limit.py` had set it
  straight. Each time an operator rebuilt the state from the timeline.

`.github/workflows/issue-status.yml` runs this on the events that break either rule:

* `event --action closed`: every `status:*` label comes off the Issue.
* `event --action labeled` with a `status:*` label: on an open Issue the status label
  applied last stays and every other one comes off; on a closed Issue every one comes
  off, the one just applied included.
* `repair`: every closed Issue that still carries a status label, listed (`--mode
  dry-run`, the default) or repaired (`--mode apply`). The catch-up for the weeks nothing
  ran, and for whatever a missed event leaves behind.

## Decided from the Issue, not from the event

A run starts seconds after its event - minutes, on a slow queue - and the Issue may have
moved in between. So a run reads the Issue as it is when the run starts, and on an open
Issue it reads which status label was applied last from the Issue's own label history,
not from the event that happened to start it. Every run of one Issue therefore reaches
the same answer whatever order the runs go in: of two labels applied a second apart the
later one stays even when the earlier one's run starts last, and a label taken off and
put back counts from when it was put back, which is the shape of #200. The label the
event applied matters only when the history has not caught up with it yet. An Issue
reopened before its closure's run starts keeps its labels: its status is live again.

## What it never does

It removes `status:*` labels and nothing else. It never adds a label - absence is a real
state before triage, and inventing a status would be worse than the ambiguity this
fixes - never touches `priority:*`, `type:*`, `area:*`, `policy` or `qa`, never closes or
reopens anything, and never touches a pull request, which the REST API lists among the
Issues and which is dropped wherever it appears.

What each run removed, who applied the label it kept, and why it removed nothing when it
did not, go to the run's step summary: a role that keeps mislabelling is visible rather
than silently corrected (#214).
