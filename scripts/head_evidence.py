"""Say on the pull request what the forge measured on its head, and what moved that head.

#765. A verdict and a handoff name "the exact head", and a loop branch that is merely
behind is merged with its base by the forge (`update_branches.py`). So every time
`master` moved — twelve mirror syncs in four days, while the specification was being
indexed — every open pull request got a new head, and the handoff and the verdict that
named the old one stopped counting. #661 changed head nine times between 2026-09-25 and
2026-09-29 without its own diff changing by a line, was green on all four required
checks throughout, and was refused for a stale handoff.

The same refusal had a second cause: the verdict owner reads the forge through a
provider that did not return the check runs of that head, and `unknown` is not `green`.
What it can read is the pull request's comments.

So the forge says both things where they can be read. For the head of an open loop pull
request on which all four required checks are green, this writes one comment:

* the four checks, each with the link it was measured at;
* the chain of heads behind it on which the pull request's own diff was the same, back
  to the head at which that diff last changed. A merge of the base leaves such a head
  behind, and so does a regeneration of the coverage table. A handoff or a verdict that
  names any head of that chain stands for this one (`AGENTS.md`).

**The pull request's own diff** is the lines it removes and the lines it adds, per file,
against the merge base with its base branch — positions dropped, because a line added
above by the base moves a hunk without changing it, and the generated coverage table
excluded, because it is regenerated from the registry on every base merge and is
presentation only. Diff identity is only a coarse signal: a real per-commit tree proof is also required to carry a verdict.
A base merge that had to resolve a conflict inside the pull request's own lines changes
what is removed or added, so its identity differs and nothing is carried across it.

This reads commits as data — `git diff`, never a checkout — and executes nothing from
the branch. It measures and reports; it never judges. A head that is not green gets no
comment: the red check is already the message.

Exit code is 0 whatever was found. The outcome is written for the workflow to act on,
and a measurement that could not be made is a warning, not a failed run.
