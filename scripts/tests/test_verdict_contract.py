"""One verdict owner and one evidence channel, in every document that names them (#544).

`AGENTS.md` is the operative contract; `docs/zendev/ENDLESSZEN_AUTHOR.md` is the guide
an author outside the loop works to; the active entry of `docs/zendev/schemes.json` is
what the dispatcher and the ledgers read. scheme/8 made SLOPSTER the verdict owner, and
the guide then told it to submit a formal review — which the contract forbids that
account, for the reason #208 and #211 record: a formal refusal from an account without
write access holds the merge until someone with authority clears it. Two documents, two
answers, and a clean pull request with no compliant way to be accepted.

The three now say one thing, and these assertions are what keeps a later policy edit
from quietly making them disagree again. Text assertions, like the other contract
tests: standard library only, and a pattern that stops matching fails loudly because
every negative check here is paired with a positive one on the same document.
