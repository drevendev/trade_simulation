"""Record a closed pull request in the private ledger: what it was, who wrote it, how it
was judged, and how long each step took.

The run ledger (``runs/``) says what each model run cost. It cannot say how fast and how
well requirements land once the AUTHOR is not a model run: under scheme/7 the researcher
writes the code as a person would, and no run records anything about a pull request it
did not open. So the unit of measurement moves from the run to the pull request, which
every author produces, and this writes one record per closed pull request — ``pulls/``
beside ``runs/``, same ledger, same identity, same scheme stamp.

Speed is read off the timestamps: opened, first verdict, merged or closed. Quality is
read off the verdicts: how many refusals by the verdict owner before it merged, whether
the first verdict accepted it, whether the forge closed it at the rework bound or as
unreachable, and how many QA findings the external voice left on it. Size and scope are
the diff and the Issue and requirement identifiers the body names. None of it is an
opinion about the code; every field is a fact GitHub already holds, copied at the one
moment it stops changing.

Written from ``master``'s definition on ``pull_request_target: closed`` (pr-ledger.yml),
so the pull request's own code never runs with the ledger credential in the
environment. A record is never the reason a pull request fails to close: every delivery
failure is a warning and exit 0, like the run recorder. The record's path is the closing
time and the number, so recording the same pull request twice — a backfill after a live
run, a repair by hand — is refused by the ledger rather than duplicated.
